                    <h1>Christian Generosity</h1>
                    <p>
                        We all live in complete dependence on God. As Christians, we have come to recognize this truth and give
                        Him honor and glory for who He is. We respond to God by trusting in Him for all our provisions and acknowledging
                        that all we have comes from Him. Christian generosity flows out of this truth and is demonstrated in our serving,
                        loving, sharing, and financial stewardship.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Giving is a major part of worshipping God in the Bible. In the Old Testament, the tithe (or 10%) was the basic
                        amount that was set aside as God's. Leviticus 27:30 says, 'Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
                        land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD.' Offerings were brought as worship to
                        God above and beyond the basic requirement of the tithe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tithing is first seen in the Old Testament but occurred before the Law was given, as Abraham tithed to
                        Melchizedek in Genesis 14, and Jacob promised to give a tenth of all God's provision back to God in Genesis 28.
                        In the New Testament, Jesus still assumed that people would tithe (Matthew 23:23). Even though we are now free
                        from the specific requirements of the Old Testament Law because of Jesus' work on the cross, the principles are
                        all affirmed in the New Testament.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Giving continues to be a focal point of the Christian life and is echoed throughout the New Testament.
                        2 Corinthians 9:6-8 tells us 'The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever
                        sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or
                        under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having
                        all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.'
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        God still expects people to demonstrate their love for Him and faith in Him by giving their resources. Our response
                         is to give our time, energy, and money in our local church home. We do this to further God's work and to worship
                         Him because we are thankful for who He is and what He has done.
                    </p>

                    <p>
