                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Updated March 17th, 2020</h1>
                <h1>Dear Bright Field Church, </h1>
                <p>
                    As of this past weekend, the Center for Disease Control recommended no gatherings larger than 50
                    people in a room. President Trump then recommended that this number be reduced to no more than 10
                    people. This number may go even smaller as things progress. We want to follow the direction of
                    professionals and government officials who are working diligently to protect our communities. Romans
                    13:1 tells us that we should be “subject to the governing authorities.” We at Bright Field Church
                    have been working on a way to support you in following Jesus while helping our communities to slow
                    the spread of the virus. Here is the plan for now:
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>Services & Small Groups</h1>

                <p>
                    1. Effective immediately, we will be suspending Sunday services (including Easter) until further
                    notice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. We will plan to record Sunday teachings and make them temporarily available for those that attend
                    Bright Field Church starting Sunday, March 29th by 10am. Please check back for details regarding
                    this process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. Small Group meetings during the week will be left up to the discretion of each Small Group.
                    Whether or not your Small Group plans to meet, please use wisdom in accordance with government
                    regulations when making your decision to attend. Some small groups will want to gather on Sunday
                    mornings to listen to the teachings together, and to pray for one another. For others, it may not be
                    feasible. We will leave that up to individual small groups to decide. In some cases, a few people
                    from a Small Group may get together to listen, while the group is not officially meeting together.
                    We will leave those decisions up to each group leader and the group members. If you are unable or
                    feel unsafe gathering, please feel free to listen from home, we trust your personal discernment in
                    making this decision. If the authorities ask us not to meet even in small groups, we will follow
                    their lead, but let’s take it one step at a time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    4. Small Group gatherings should take precautions to minimize risks to attendees, including:
                    sanitizing the meeting spaces, limiting personal contact (please consider friendly greetings rather
                    than hugs or handshakes), and washing of hands (or using hand sanitizer) before and after prayer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    5. If Small Groups with children meet Sunday morning to listen to the teaching together, childcare
                    should be taken care of by parents in rotation, rather than bringing in childcare workers. We
                    recognize that older kids might join adults, while younger kids may need dedicated space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6. Depending on how things progress, we will decide how to move forward in terms of weekly
                    gatherings. We are doing our best to make decisions that help the church through this while being
                    wise in the process.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>Personal Wellness</h1>

                <p>
                    1. Please hold to best health practices, including regular hand washing, covering your face when
                    coughing/sneezing (with a tissue or elbow), and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. If you are sick – experiencing fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or other flu-like
                    symptoms, please stay home and refrain from gathering with the church or your small group until
                    recovered. We encourage you to reach out to your small group, so that they may pray for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. If you are at higher risk due to age, various health conditions, or other personal or
                    professional circumstances, we encourage you to use wisdom. If you feel safer staying at home, we
                    encourage you to do so. If you need assistance, we encourage you to reach out to your small group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. If your children are sick, please keep them home from church functions and small groups.

                </p>
                <p>
                    5. The Bright Field Church Offices will remain open during regular operating hours throughout the
                    week.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>Giving</h1>
                <p>
                    1. If Bright Field Church is your church home, please be faithful and consistent in your tithes and
                    offerings so that we are able to continue in the things Jesus has asked of us and, when this
                    disruption is over, we are still able to move forward effectively.
                    ‍</p>
                <p>
                    2. Because we don’t have regular Sunday morning gatherings as a place to give tithes and offerings,
                    you can continue giving your tithes and offerings by using a few different options:
                </p>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li class="serving-login">Bright Field has an online giving option (Clover) through the “giving”
                        page on our website, or
                        you can use this link directly: <a href="https://app.clovergive.com/App/Giving/brig203141">
                            Clover Give</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>We have set up an app-based giving option through Tithe.ly. If you choose to use this option,
                        simply download the Tithe.ly app from the app store, search “Bright Field Church” in their list
                        of participating churches, and enter your giving information.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can also drop off, or mail, tithes and offerings to the Bright Field Church office at 203 E
                        Locust St DeKalb, IL 60115.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Caring For Each other</h1>

                <p>
                    1. It is an important time to care for and encourage each other! The uncertainty puts all of us a
                    little bit on edge, but we have great reason to trust Jesus and go forward with confidence. Praying
                    together, talking on FaceTime, and texting are all ways for us to stay connected and give each other
                    courage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. When friends from your small group are sick, figure out how to help them. Prepare a meal and
                    leave it outside their door. Take them flowers. Buy them toilet paper. Anything to encourage and
                    build up their faith and confidence that Jesus is with them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Jesus’ church is not fragile! Let’s do our best to not be afraid, to give one another courage, and
                    to trust him as we walk this out. His promise “I am with you always, to the end of the age” in
                    Matthew 28:20 is still true. And Romans 8:28, “And we know that for those who love God all things
                    work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose,” encourages us that God
                    is at work for our good even through difficult times. We believe that Bright Field Church will come
                    outthe other side of this stronger and full of faith and confidence in Jesus. He has given us a
                    mission to help people know Jesus. Let us live out our faith and be a strength to those around us
                    during this time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One more thing…PRAY. Pray for each other, pray for our city, our country, and our world. The work he
                    has given us is carried out through prayer. And prayer keeps us close to Jesus and keeps us from
                    being anxious or afraid. “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your
                    reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in
                    everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And
                    the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
                    Jesus” (Philippians 4:4-7).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll keep you up to date and inform you of any changes as they come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hope to see you soon, <br>
