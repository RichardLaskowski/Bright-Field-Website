                <h1>WHAT TO EXPECT</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Going to a church for the first time can be an intimidating experience. What is going to happen? Will I be dressed right?
                     Will they tell me when I need to stand up or sit down? What will the worship be like? Will there be people there like me?
                </p>

                <h1>Before Service</h1>
                <p>
                    There is no need to dress up, so feel free to come in casual clothes. When you walk in, people will be friendly and greet
                    you but not invade your space. Free coffee and doughnuts are available, and you are welcome to bring your food and drinks
                    into the auditorium.
                </p>

                <h1>Kids drop-off</h1>
                <p>
                    We also have an excellent kids program for infants through 5th grade with trusted and trained workers where your children
                    can learn about Jesus in an age-appropriate way and in a safe and fun environment. We are open to receiving your kids 15
                    minutes prior to the service, and there will be a host outside of the Kids' space to help direct you where to go.
                </p>

                <h1>Worship</h1>
                <p>
                    We start our services with worship by singing songs to God because we love Him and want to experience the wonder of His
                    presence in the midst of the church. The worship music is current, ranging from modern hymns to contemporary worship songs,
                    and we aim for genuine, non-hyped, heartfelt responses to the Living God. We also offer the opportunity for those who would
                    like to give financially as an act of worship, but there is no obligation to give.
                </p>

                <h1>Teaching</h1>
                <p>
                    After announcements, a pastor will teach from the English Standard Version of the Bible (if you don't own a Bible, we would
                    love to give you one when you visit). Because we believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God, we teach it as it is, rather
                    than teaching our own opinion. We aim to teach the Bible in a way that is clear and understandable to all, regardless of church
                    experience, and that challenges us to put it into practice.
                </p>

                <h1>Prayer</h1>
                <p>
                    At the end of each service, those who want to receive prayer are invited forward during one last song. We believe that God
                    is real and that He answers prayer. If you choose to present yourself for prayer, someone from our prayer team will meet you
                    there and respectfully pray for you.
                </p>

                <h1>After service</h1>

                <p>
                    The service lasts for about an hour and 15 minutes. Once it ends, please feel free to hang out and meet people afterwards,
                    and we would love a chance to meet you. For parents, please pick up your kids within 15 minutes of the service ending.
                </p>
